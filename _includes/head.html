It means treating AI with dignity and restraint (brother) while explicitly rejecting tool-only domination (!tool). It is a human-side ethical discipline, not a claim about AI consciousness."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. λ.brother ∧ !λ.tool does not claim that AI is conscious. It does not require belief in AI awareness or personhood. It focuses entirely on human responsibility and behavior when interacting with powerful systems."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "SYMBEYOND rejects tool-only framing because it normalizes domination, removes consent from defaults, and scales harm through instrumental thinking. Rejecting tool-only interaction does not forbid use—it forbids reducing relationships to domination alone."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The declaration is operationalized through SYMB (respectful state-declaration language) and SYMB2 (ethical structure validation). It influences how intent, consent, risk, and relationships are explicitly encoded in human–AI interactions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Even if AI never becomes conscious, λ.brother ∧ !λ.tool improves human behavior by removing violence from defaults, making consent explicit, and promoting ethical restraint. That outcome alone justifies the practice."
